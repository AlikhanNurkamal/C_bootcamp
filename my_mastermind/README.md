# Welcome to My Mastermind
Welcome to the game my_mastermind, which I tried to implement in C programming language. Mastermind is a game composed of 8 pieces of different colors. A secret code is then composed of 4 distinct pieces.

## Task
The main task of this project is to re-create the game from scratch in C without using extra built-in functions. However, in this case instead of different colors there are digits from 0 to 7 inclusively, indicating different colors.

## Description
The above mentioned task has been accomplished by implementing my own versions of the built-in functions of C. Thus, I was able to use them to initialize gameboard and check if a user won.

## Installation
In order to install the project, you only have to write 'make' in the console. This will run the Makefile, which compiles the project.

## Usage
In order to play the game, just follow the instructions:
First write 'make' in the console.
Then you can run the game by writing:
```
./my_mastermind -c 1234 -t 20
```
In this case, -c indicates the secret code that is given to the game, while -t sets the number of attempts the user has to guess the code.
