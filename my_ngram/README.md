# Welcome to My Ngram

## Task
We need to write a program in C that will count the number of occurrences per character in given strings.

## Description
We have used a simple array of 128 characters (since this is the number of characters in ASCII table that is supported by C language). Each time a character is found in a string, its appropriate index is increased in the array.

## Installation
To install the project, just type "make" in the terminal. Then you can launch the program by executing:
```
./my_ngram "string here"
```

## Usage
How does the project work? It is very simple, as you will need to follow the following commands template in your terminal:
```
make
./my_ngram argument1 argument2
```
