# Welcome to Quest08

## Task
The main task of this quest is to create high-level and very powerful functions in C that include:
* splitting the string into an array of strings whenever a given separator is met
* removing all unnecessary spaces from a given string
* and seeking for a word inside another word maintaining the same order of characters.

## Description
These functions are very easy to implement as they only require prior knowledge of pointers in C and of malloc( ) function. Using these two, one can easily manipulate strings in C.

## Usage
In order to use the functions, just compile the programs using:
```
gcc -o name file.c
```
And then run the program with the function:
```
./name
```
